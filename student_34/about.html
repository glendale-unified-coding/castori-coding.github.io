<h1> About Gaster </h1>
<h3> W.D. Gaster was the Royal Scientist in the Underground, setting of the game Undertale. However, one day he inexplicably “fell into his own creation” and was shattered across space and time, divided and non-existent, forced to watch as the world went on, just fine without him. </h3>
<br>
<h3>There are very few pieces of evidence indicating that Gaster ever really existed. There is some in-game evidence, which you can find in the “In-Game Appearances” section. However, most of the popular knowledge that surrounds Gaster is fandom based. </h3>
<br>
<h3> In some Undertale fandom-based comics and stories (as well as copious amounts of fanart and “fanart”), Gaster is depicted to be a loving father to the skeleton brothers Sans and Papyrus. His work appears to affect Sans, who seems to have scientific knowledge, both in the game and in the fandom. The Skeleton Family is depicted to be very close knit and happy, like a normal family, until Gaster eventually “falls into his creation”. </h3>
<br>
<h3> In other instances, such as GolzyBladeDee’s comic series based on an alternate universe of Undertale, or in the ongoing comic series “Handplates” by Zarla, Gaster is a cruel scientist that experiments on the boys. He does whatever it takes to shatter the Barrier that imprisons his race Underground, including torture, both physical and mental. Then, someone either pushes him into the Core, the speculated cause of his disappearance, out of spite, or he falls on his own.</h3>
<br>
<h3>The thing Gaster appears to have fallen in is the Core, his creation. The Core is a massive structure that generates power for the entire Underground. Many say that he fell into it and some component in the Core scrambled him and left him shattered. However, recent theories such as one from the famous Game Theorist MatPat says this is wrong. Evidence says that Gaster fell into a blaster like creation. The current Royal Scientist found mysterious blueprints that enabled her to create a blaster/extraction device. The weapon that boss monster Sans uses in the Genocide Run is called a “Gaster Blaster”. The weapon that boss monster Asriel Dreemurr uses, the so-called “Hyper Goner”, resembles both of these other cannons. He says that it has the power to erase you from the minds of everybody that you befriended. Sound familiar? He threatens you with the same fate that Royal Scientist W.D. Gaster faced.</h3>
