<h1> About Gaster </h1>
<h3>  Ah, W.D. Gaster. The renowned scientist of the Underground, the world below the Surface, the land of the banished monsters in the Undertale. Perhaps first, I should tell what Undertale even was.</h3>
  Undertale: The Game where you don't have to kill everyone.
  It seems too good to be true, and indeed, it is. Players of this game have the option to either FIGHT or SPARE their enemies. Genocide, Neutral, and Pacifist Routes are determined by LV and EXP, LV or LOVE standing for Level Of ViolencE and EXP standing for Execution Points.
  So how does W.D. Gaster relate to all of this? Indeed, he is- or rather, was- the old Royal Scientist to King Asgore, ruler of the monsters in the Underground. The monsters of the Underground were actually kindly creatures much like humans themselves, but they oft looked like hybrids or human and animal hybrids, or weird combinations between nature's creations. While each human SOUL held a certain concentrated trait, monster souls were blank white. Their SOULs were based on magic, as were their attacks.
