      <h1> The Instruments </h1>
      Hey! My name is Alena, and I will be giving a brief summaries of the instrument families and each instrument in that family.

      <h2> This is the string family, which consists of the violin, the viola, the cello, and the double bass. All instruments have four strings and have similar structures, though they vary in size and pitch. Both the violin and the double bass have G, D, A, and E strings; however, the violin produces a high pitch, while the double bass produces a much lower pitch. The viola and cello have both C, G, D, and A strings, though the viola plays higher in pitch than the cello. All instruments are played with a bow. Fun Fact: I play the viola, and personally I like the viola. </h2>

      <h2> This is the woodwind family, which consists of the flute, the oboe, the clarinet, the bassoon, and the saxophone (and more which I shall not include.) I like the saxophone the best. </h2>
