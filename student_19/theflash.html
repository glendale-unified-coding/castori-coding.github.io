    Hey guys! This is my "first website", which actually isn't my first website, but I guess it's close enough, right?
   <h1> I like to code. (No kidding, that's why I'm in coding class.) </h1>
    <h2> I like to make websites, even if they're as plain as HTML can get. </h2>
     <h3> Code is cool. Actually coding it - well, it's a slightly different opinion. </h3>
      <h4> Look at all the headings that don't deserve to be headings. </h4>
   <p> I am not interesting at all. I shall call myself a person of interests, however. </p>

    <marquee> why is this called a marquee; did you not have anything else to call it? </marquee>
