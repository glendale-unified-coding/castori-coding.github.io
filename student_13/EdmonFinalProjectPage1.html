Futbol Club Barcelona, commonly known as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is a
professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, 
the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, 
their slogan is "Més que un club" (More than a club). Unlike many other football clubs, 
the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the second most valuable sports team in
the world, worth $3.56 billion, and the world's second richest football club in terms of revenue, 
with an annual turnover of €560.8 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", 
written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.
Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated 
from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became 
the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, 
and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first football club to win six out of 
six competitions in a single year, completing the sextuple in also winning the Spanish Super Cup,
UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.
 In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, 
which reached a record six consecutive Champions League semi-finals and won 14 trophies in just 
four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.
By winning their fifth Champions League trophy on 6 June 2015, Barcelona became the first European club
in history to achieve the continental treble twice.
